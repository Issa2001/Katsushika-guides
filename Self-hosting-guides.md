([Mongo-Atlas-Guide](https://github.com/Issa2001/Katsushika-guides/blob/main/Mongo-Atlas-guide.md))

Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/) to install MongoDB in your system

`EIF` is the main endpoint of the [Express-is-fun APIs](https://express-is-fun.herokuapp.com/api). \

If you want the chatbot functionality add this url there: `https://express-is-fun.herokuapp.com`. Leave it empty if you don't want the chatbot functionality
